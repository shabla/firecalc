# TODO

- Replace Minimum Retirement Withdrawal with 2 text inputs:
    - Safe Withdrawal (default 4%)
    - Target Retirement Income (default 40000$)
    These 2 togeter will determine when the row is READY

- Edit income/expense -> ids are fucked, onSave handler is hacky as fuck, remove that shit
- Add "until/to" field for recurring cash flow (ex: get 1000 per week from 2035 to 2045)
- Add checkbox to determine if the cash flow will continue in retirement or not (ex: stop working when you're ready)
- store filters to local storage
- load default filters from local storage
- delete confirmation (like insomnia)
- display action button on hover? or in a submenu?
