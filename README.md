# TODO

- FEAT: Add option in recurring type for source to start at a specific age (ex. OAS, pension, etc)
- FEAT: recurring starting at a given age instead of given year
- FEAT: recurring starting in retirement
    - done: edit cash flow dialog, now make them work fo'real

- REFACTOR: rename untilYear to untilValue (make it like starting), rename year to fixedYear or something like that
    - better idea: compose the cashflow based on the starting and until types instead of having all the optiosn for all fields present

- FEAT: changing the year might break the starting/ending income year
- FEAT: delete confirmation (like insomnia)
- FEAT: delete all with confirmation
- UX:   display action button on hover? or in a submenu?
