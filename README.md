# TODO

- Edit income/expense -> ids are fucked, onSave handler is hacky as fuck, remove that shit
- Add "until/to" field for recurring cash flow (ex: get 1000 per week from 2035 to 2045)
- Add checkbox to determine if the cash flow will continue in retirement or not (ex: stop working when you're ready)
- store filters to local storage
- load default filters from local storage
- delete confirmation (like insomnia)
- display action button on hover? or in a submenu?
